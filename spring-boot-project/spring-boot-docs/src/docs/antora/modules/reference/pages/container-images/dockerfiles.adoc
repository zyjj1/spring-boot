While it is possible to convert a Spring Boot uber jar into a docker image with just a few lines in the Dockerfile, we will use the xref:container-images/efficient-images.adoc#container-images.efficient-images.layering[layering feature] to create an optimized docker image.
When you create a jar containing the layers index file, the `spring-boot-jarmode-tools` jar will be added as a dependency to your jar.
With this jar on the classpath, you can launch your application in a special mode which allows the bootstrap code to run something entirely different from your application, for example, something that extracts the layers.

CAUTION: The `tools` mode can not be used with a xref:deployment/installing.adoc[fully executable Spring Boot archive] that includes a launch script.
Disable launch script configuration when building a jar file that is intended to be used with `layertools`.

Hereâ€™s how you can launch your jar with a `tools` jar mode:

[source,shell]
----
$ java -Djarmode=tools -jar my-app.jar
----

This will provide the following output:

[subs="verbatim"]
----
Usage:
  java -Djarmode=tools -jar my-app.jar

Available commands:
  extract      Extract the contents from the jar
  list-layers  List layers from the jar that can be extracted
  help         Help about any command
----

The `extract` command can be used to easily split the application into layers to be added to the dockerfile.
Here is an example of a Dockerfile using `jarmode`.

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM bellsoft/liberica-runtime-container:jre-17-cds-slim-glibc as builder
WORKDIR /builder
ARG JAR_FILE=target/*.jar
COPY ${JAR_FILE} application.jar
RUN java -Djarmode=tools -jar application.jar extract --layers --destination extracted

FROM bellsoft/liberica-runtime-container:jre-17-cds-slim-glibc
WORKDIR /application
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/dependencies/ ./
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/spring-boot-loader/ ./
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/snapshot-dependencies/ ./
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/application/ ./
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "application.jar"]
----

Assuming the above `Dockerfile` is in the current directory, your docker image can be built with `docker build .`, or optionally specifying the path to your application jar, as shown in the following example:

[source,shell]
----
$ docker build --build-arg JAR_FILE=path/to/myapp.jar .
----

This is a multi-stage dockerfile.
The builder stage extracts the directories that are needed later.
Each of the `COPY` commands relates to the layers extracted by the jarmode.

Of course, a Dockerfile can be written without using the jarmode.
You can use some combination of `unzip` and `mv` to move things to the right layer but jarmode simplifies that.
Additionally, the layout created by the jarmode is CDS friendly out of the box.
